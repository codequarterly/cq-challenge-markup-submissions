** Grammar

As mentioned above, the Markup grammar defines a mapping between a
Markup document and an abstract syntax tree. The tree is built out of
tagged elements and strings.\note{Markup was originally developed in
Lisp where the obvious representation for a Markup document is as
s-expressions, with each tree represented by a list whose first
element is a symbol indicating the treeâ€™s tag.

   (:body
     (:h1 "This is a header")
     (:p "This is a paragraph")
     (:p "This is another paragraph with some" (:i "italic") " text in it."))

} The abstract syntax tree is rooted in a single element whose tag is
\code{body}. Its children are the elements described below.
