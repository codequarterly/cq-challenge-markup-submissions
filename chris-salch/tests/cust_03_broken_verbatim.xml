    <h2>Grammar</h2>
    <p>As mentioned above, the Markup grammar defines a mapping between a Markup document and an abstract syntax tree. The tree is built out of tagged elements and strings.
    <note>
        <p>Markup was originally developed in Lisp where the obvious representation for a Markup document is as s-expressions, with each tree represented by a list whose first element is a symbol indicating the treeâ€™s tag.</p>
        <pre>(:body
  (:h1 "This is a header")
  (:p "This is a paragraph")
  (:p "This is another paragraph with some" (:i "italic") " text in it."))</pre>
    </note>
     The abstract syntax tree is rooted in a single element whose tag is <code>body</code>. Its children are the elements described below.</p>
</body>
