\note{Markup was originally developed in
Lisp where the obvious representation for a Markup document is as
s-expressions, with each tree represented by a list whose first
element is a symbol indicating the treeâ€™s tag.

   (:body
     (:h1 "This is a header")
     (:p "This is a paragraph")
     (:p "This is another paragraph with some" (:i "italic") " text in it."))

This kind of tree structure also has an obvious representation in XML
or HTML:

   <body>
     <h1>This is a header</h1>
     <p>This is a paragraph</p>
     <p>This is another paragraph with some <i>italic</i> text in it.</p>
   </body>
