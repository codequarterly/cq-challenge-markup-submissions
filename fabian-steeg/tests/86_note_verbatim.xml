        <p>Markup was originally developed in Lisp where the obvious representation for a Markup document is as s-expressions, with each tree represented by a list whose first element is a symbol indicating the treeâ€™s tag.</p>
        <pre>(:body
  (:h1 &quot;This is a header&quot;)
  (:p &quot;This is a paragraph&quot;)
  (:p &quot;This is another paragraph with some&quot; (:i &quot;italic&quot;) &quot; text in it.&quot;))</pre>
        <p>This kind of tree structure also has an obvious representation in XML or HTML:</p>
        <pre>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;This is a header&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph with some &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; text in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>
