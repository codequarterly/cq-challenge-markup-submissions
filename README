This repo contains the four submissions I received in the Code
Quarterly Markup Code Challenge. Due to the shuttering of Code
Quarterly I will not be doing a more detailed write-up of these
submissions, as originally planned.

I do want to thank the four coders who submitted their code and
acknowledge their effort: quite a number of people forked the code on
GitHub but these four were the ones who followed through to
completion:

   Chris Salch, implementing in Perl

   Fabian Steeg, implementing in Scala

   Luis Pedro Coelho, implementing in Haskell

   Henrik Ravn, implementing in F#

You'll find their code in the subdirectories of this project. Read and
enjoy.
